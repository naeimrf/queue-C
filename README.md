## Practice queue structure in C programming
A general queue structure
http://www.it.uu.se/edu/course/homepage/progbrygg/ht18/c/assignments/as4/index.html

Requirements:  
a. It should be possible to enter any type of records in the queue.  
b. It should be possible to have several queues, possibly with with different types of values in the same program.  
c. There should be no explicit upper limit of the number of elements in a queue.  
d. It should be possible to use the queues without knowledge of the internal representation.  
e. All operations shall be implemented as functions/subroutines.  
f. The operations encode, decode and qLength should run in constant time, i.e. must be independent of the length of the queue.  
g. The specified names of functions and datatypes must be used - otherwise our test programs will not work.
